# mimibazar_analysis
An analysis of Mimibazar recipes done for Digital Academy.
This is a student project for learning purposes.
There are 3 files with python scripts I used during the data download, cleansing and working with the json file from Geneea software.
I also attach the last csv file I used for my analysis. Enjoy the content if you are interested.
